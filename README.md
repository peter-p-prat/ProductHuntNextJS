### What was the objective that motivated me to develop this project

- Get started with Next.js

- Learn about Next.js dinamic Routing:
  When the user clicks to open an article, nextjs dynamically generates a clean path to a new page and gets product information + comments + votes from database.

-Restricting the votes that a user can cast. By saving the voter's id of each vote a product receives, he will no longer be able to vote again.

### What would I improve about this project

- It is definitely pending to improve the adaptability of the forms to mobile screens
